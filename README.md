# :heavy_check_mark: My idea

  - Using the button for starting and ending the button: change the text and image when clicked
  - By defaut, addin will run automaticaly when revit start and stop when revit close
  - The elements created, modified will stocked the date changed in the 2 shared parameter
  - One parameter indicate date of today, one parameter will use for the status of changing
  - Create the addin manager to show, color, select the changed element by jour
